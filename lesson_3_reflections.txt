——Commands——

git remote add origin url : 	Adds a new remote location for the Github repository with the link “url”
git push origin master : 	Pushes the master branch from your local drive to the remote location on Github
git pull origin master : 	Gets the master branch from the remote location on Github and puts it on to your local drive
git fetch origin : 		Gets the changes from remote location into the origin/master branch

——When to Use a Remote Repository——
It is helpful to use a remote repository when you have multiple people collaborating locally on a project and want to maintain a master version of the project online. This way, each individual can have their local version of the repository with the master source code published in the remote repository.

——Manual vs. Automatic Pull——
You might want to always pull changes manually from the remote to your local repository because there could be multiple contributors to the remote who are editing the code at once. If this is the case, then an automatic pull would be quite confusing because there would be multiple modifications to the original repository, from various contributors, while you are trying to edit a different feature on your local version of the repository.
